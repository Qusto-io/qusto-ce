## 🔓 Open-Core Model

Qusto uses an **open-core model** that balances open-source values with sustainable business practices.

### What's Open Source (This Repository)

- ✅ Core analytics engine
- ✅ Privacy-focused event tracking
- ✅ Dashboard UI
- ✅ API access
- ✅ Self-hosting support
- ✅ Basic goal tracking
- ✅ CSV/API data export

### What's Proprietary (Qusto Cloud Only)

- 💎 **E-commerce Funnels**: Product → cart → checkout → revenue, built in
- 💎 **Channel attribution**: See which sources — including AI assistants — lead to orders
- 💎 **Advanced Attribution**: Cookieless multi-touch attribution for growing teams
- 💎 **Managed operations**: EU hosting, updates, backups, compliance docs, priority support

### Why This Model?

We believe in **sustainable open source**. The open-core model allows us to:

1. **Keep the core free forever** - Self-host without limits
2. **Fund ongoing development** - Premium features support the project
3. **Maintain transparency** - Core analytics logic is open for audit
4. **Give you choice** - Start free, upgrade when you need more

## ✨ Why Qusto?

Here's what makes Qusto Analytics a great choice for privacy-focused analytics:

- **Clutter Free**: Simple web analytics that cuts through the noise. Get all the important insights on one single page. No training necessary.
- **GDPR/CCPA/PECR compliant**: Measure traffic, not individuals. No personal data or IP addresses are ever stored. We don't use cookies or any other persistent identifiers.
- **Lightweight**: Our tracking script is tiny, making your website quicker to load. You can also send events directly to our Events API.
- **Email or Slack reports**: Keep an eye on your traffic with weekly and/or monthly email or Slack reports. You can also get traffic spike notifications.
- **Invite team members and share stats**: Your website stats are private by default but you can choose to make them public or invite team members with different roles.
- **Define key goals and track conversions**: Create custom events with custom dimensions to track conversions and understand the trends that matter.
- **EU-First**: All data processing happens exclusively in the EU on European-owned infrastructure.
