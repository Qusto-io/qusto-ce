Today, we're excited to introduce **Qusto Analytics** — a privacy-first web analytics platform built specifically for e-commerce businesses.

## Why We Built Qusto

The e-commerce analytics landscape has a fundamental problem: **you shouldn't have to choose between understanding your customers and respecting their privacy.**

Google Analytics has been deemed illegal in multiple EU countries. Cookie banners hurt conversion rates. Traditional analytics platforms weren't built for online stores — they were adapted for them.

We built Qusto to solve these problems.

## What Makes Qusto Different

### 1. 🛒 E-commerce First

Unlike generic web analytics tools, Qusto is designed from the ground up for online stores:

- **Product-level analytics**: See which products drive revenue, not just pageviews
- **Cart abandonment tracking**: Identify drop-off points and calculate lost revenue automatically
- **Conversion funnels**: Track the complete journey from product view to purchase
- **Revenue analytics**: Understand what really drives your bottom line

### 2. 🤖 AI Search Tracking

We're the **first privacy-first platform** to track AI search referrals.

ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude are becoming major traffic sources. Research shows 63.6% of businesses now receive traffic from AI search engines — but traditional analytics lump this into "direct" or "unknown" sources.

Qusto tracks AI search traffic separately, giving you insights your competitors don't have.

### 3. 🔒 Privacy by Default

Qusto is **100% GDPR compliant** out of the box:

- **No cookies**: We don't use cookies or require cookie consent banners
- **No personal data**: We don't collect IP addresses, fingerprints, or any PII
- **EU hosting**: All data is stored on servers in Germany (Hetzner)
- **No cross-site tracking**: We only track your visitors on your site

This means better user experience, higher conversion rates, and zero compliance headaches.

## Who Is Qusto For?

Qusto is built for **European e-commerce businesses** — especially those generating €1-10M in annual revenue.

Perfect for:

- Shopify stores
- WooCommerce sites
- Spanish e-commerce (SL, SLU, SA) needing LOPD compliance
